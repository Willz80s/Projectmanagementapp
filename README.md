# Projectmanagementapp
A modern, lightweight project management web application designed to help individuals and teams organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate efficiently.
Built with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and future DevOps readiness, this project demonstrates my ability to apply full-stack development principles while learning deployment, automation, and reliability concepts.




 Project Overview

This project allows users to:

Create, assign, and manage tasks across multiple projects

Track progress using dynamic dashboards and status indicators

Set deadlines and monitor completion timelines

Collaborate seamlessly through task updates and user roles


The goal is to provide a simple yet extensible foundation that could scale into a full enterprise-grade project tracking system in the future.

 Key Learning Focus

This app is part of my continuous learning journey toward becoming a Full-Stack Developer and future DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer.
Through this project, I’m practicing:

Building RESTful APIs and managing data persistence

Implementing authentication and security best practices

Using Git for collaboration and version control

Exploring deployment pipelines and containerization with Docker

Understanding system reliability and scalability concepts



What Makes It Different

Unlike many to-do or task apps, this project is designed with long-term scalability and team use-cases in mind.
It’s structured in a way that can evolve into:

A multi-user environment with role-based access

Integration with cloud services (AWS, Firebase)

Automated deployment workflows (CI/CD)

Monitoring dashboards for system reliability
